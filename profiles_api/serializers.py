"""
In Django, serializers.py is a Python module that provides a way to convert
complex data types such as Django models into Python data types such as
dictionaries and lists that can be easily serialized into formats such
as JSON, XML, and YAML.

The main purpose of serializers.py is to help you serialize and deserialize
data in your Django application. It provides a way to convert data from
one format to another so that it can be easily transmitted over the network
or stored in a database.

For example, you might use a serializer to convert a Django model instance
into a JSON object that can be returned as an HTTP response. Or you might
use a serializer to convert an incoming JSON request into a Django model
instance that can be saved to a database.
